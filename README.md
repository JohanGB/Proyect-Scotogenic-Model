# Proyect-Scotogenic-Model

  ->Study the dark matter phenomenology with SARAH->SPheno and micrOmegas.
  
  ->Study what is the relic density in the freeze-out scenario. 
  
  ->Find correlation between the relic density and other parameters from the model.  
  
  ->Study of the three viable candidates for dark matter.  
  
  ->Main processes contributing to the relic density will be made.
